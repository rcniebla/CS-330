1.	How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is to try to find like functionality to group together and to break the problem down into small functional parts.  For instance, in module 8 I worked the requirements independently and when I was complete with one, I would test and ensure it wasn’t breaking any other functionality.  Then, after the code is working how I intended I go through to see if there are any functions that need breaking up or any place it looks like the code needs help and try to make it more easily read. 
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
I take very much the same approach as I do when designing.  I break things apart into manageable chunks.  During development I often hit snags or issue and must then check different knowledge bases and stack overflow to see if anyone else has experienced the sort of issues I experienced and how they overcame it.  Generally I don’t find an exact match to what I am looking for but I can get close enough to be able o figure out the rest. 
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science knowledge is my goal. Anything that helps me understand computer science more will help as I work towards my degree.  In this class I was able to get a little more familiar with C++ specifically I was able to work with pointers a good deal. There is a lot to openGl and working with it has given me a good understanding of some of the basics but I am anxious to delve into it a little deeper on my own to get a firmer understanding.
